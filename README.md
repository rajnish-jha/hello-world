# hello-world
This is my first hello-worl repository. In this I will try to learn some basic things like:

# What is GitHub:
GitHub is a code hosting platform for code version control and collaboration. So using GitHub we can work together with others on a project anywhere.
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

# What is Git:
Git is a version control software just like SVN and CVS. GitHub is built on Git.
It is a version control software that GitHub is built on).

# What is Repository--> how to create and use repository:
Repository is a place where we can keep our project i.e. our source code. A repository can contains files, folders, directories, images, videos, spreadsheet and data set. 
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.
Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project.

# What is Branch --> how to create and manage new branch:
Banches lets you to create an exact copy of your Repository (i.e. your main branch) . Whenever we create a repository in GitHub then GitHub  creates one branch associated with this repositoty called main branch by default. So if we want to create another branch for your repository then we can create.
We can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.
So when we create a (new branch from a main branch) branch off the main branch, then it means that we're making an exact copy, or snapshot, of main brach as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
Branching means saving diffrent versions of a file and once saved then it needs to be merged to the main branch.
Usually developers, designers, writers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into main.
Let's suppose I create one branch called readme-edits on my hello-world repository then Now we have two branches, main and readme-edits. 
Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new branch and then merge with the main btach.


# What is commit means in GitHub:
Commit is basically used to make changes to a file and push them to Github as commits. SO if we make any changes to a file then we use commit i.e. save a file after making chages and push them to a GitHub. So commit means to save a file after making some chages.
You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.

# What is Pull Request:
It is a popular way to create and review code.
Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When we open a pull request, then we're proposing our changes and requesting that someone review and pull in our contribution or changes and merge them into their main branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.
As soon as we make a commit, we can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

# Note:
These changes will be made only to the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from main.
Now that we have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.
